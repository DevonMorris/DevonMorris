# Hi there, I'm Devon Morris ðŸ‘‹
My life mission is to create simple, generic, and highly-flexible systems to solve the biggest problems in autonomy and robotics.

I have broad background in mathematics, electrical engineering and computer science that has put me on the path to achieve this mission.

I currently work at [Tangram Vision](https://www.tangramvision.com/) as a perception engineer.
